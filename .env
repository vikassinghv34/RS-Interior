# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \sitecore\config\jss-practice.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.
# See https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/fundamentals/services/view-engine
# If undefined, http://localhost:3000 is used by default.
# In production non-editing environments it is desirable to use relative URLs, so this may be set to empty string.

# To secure the Sitecore editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
# (`/api/editing/render` by default), a secret token is used. This (client-side)
# value must match your server-side value (see \sitecore\config\jss-practice.config).
# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

# higher environment (since `scjssconfig.json` is ignored from source control).
# In this case, use this environment variable to provide the value at build time.

# Sitecore JSS npm packages utilize the debug module for debug logging.
# https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug
# Set the DEBUG environment variable to 'sitecore-jss:*' to see all logs:

# Or be selective and show for example only layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:layout
# Or everything BUT layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*,-sitecore-jss:layout
